Website Structure
=================
MVC Folder Structure details :
> app 
    > controller
    > core
    > models
    > views
> public
    > css
    > js
    > img
    
1) app :
    - folder contains the application specific code .
    - Access to this folder is restricted by an .htaccess file located in this folder. 
    - The folder core:
        - contains a file App.php 
            - that is responsible for bootstrapping our application and making its URL's SEO friendly.
            -  if our URL is group14.com/somemodels/somemethod/first-item, then
                Controller is somemodels
                Model is Somemodels_model 
                Method is somemethod
                View is somemethod
                Query String is an array (first-item)
            - core also contains base controller "Controller.php" , which other controllers extend.
            - core also included Database.php which is responsible for creating database connections.   
    -app contains:
        - a directory "controller" which contains all the controllers
        - a directory "models" which contains the models
        - views which contains the views .
            the folder views contain common files like header.php  and footer.php in its root , these are used by other views to give consistent look to the application.
        
    - the root of app folder contains files init.php( which handles includes) and global.php (which contains settings)
2) public : 
    - contains application specific js/css/images . 
    - .htaccess file to our public folder which redirect all calls to index.php. while doing so we make sure make sure that the path requested is not a filename or directory. So there is direct access to files like "/img/someimage.jpeg" if they exists in public folder.
    - index.php is the access point to our application which does so by calling include on init.php and creating the instance of class App.


Why we have app and public folders separate:
============================================
This allows us to fine tune access restrictions to these folders. making our application code (app folder) not visible to public,
while still allowing access to files and folders of public folder available to outside world.

HOWTO deploy in local
======================
For local user.

Make sure you change the variable in these files to local path.

1. app/global.php
2. public/.htaccess

Remember set it back before you commit. Add some comments whenever you do commit.
